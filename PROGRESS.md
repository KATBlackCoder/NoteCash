## Lessons Learned

- Importance of null checking in computed properties
- Benefits of component composition for reusability
- Proper error handling patterns for async operations
- Effective use of Vue 3's Composition API with TypeScript
- Importance of proper state management with Pinia
- Benefits of using native dialog plugins for better UX
