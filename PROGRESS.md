## Lessons Learned

- Importance of null checking in computed properties
- Benefits of component composition for reusability
- Proper error handling patterns for async operations
- Effective use of Vue 3's Composition API with TypeScript
- Importance of proper state management with Pinia
- Benefits of using native dialog plugins for better UX
- Value of extracting reusable components for complex UI elements
- Importance of clear separation of concerns between pages
- Importance of wrapping the application with necessary Naive UI providers (Dialog, Message, etc.) at the root level
- Properly configuring validation triggers and rules in Naive UI forms is crucial for correct behavior
- Thoroughly logging and inspecting database results is essential for debugging data flow issues
- Robust error handling should include both logging and user-facing feedback with recovery options
- Dynamic imports can improve application performance by loading libraries only when needed
- TypeScript type assertions are sometimes necessary when working with DOM elements
